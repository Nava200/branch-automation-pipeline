# Branch Automation Pipeline

## Overview
This project automates the process of identifying, archiving, and deleting branches in a GitHub repository using Jenkins. The goal is to automatically manage stale branches based on their last commit time. If a branch hasnâ€™t been updated for a specified period, it will be archived or deleted based on its age.

## Features
- **Branch Identification**: Identifies branches in a repository that are older than a certain time threshold.
- **Archiving Branches**: Archives branches that haven't been updated in over 90 minutes.
- **Deleting Branches**: Deletes branches that haven't been updated in over 180 minutes.
- **Notifications**: Sends email notifications to a designated recipient about branches to archive or delete.
- **Jenkins Integration**: The pipeline is fully integrated with Jenkins for continuous execution and automation.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. **Checkout SCM**
   This stage checks out the source code from the GitHub repository using the GitHub credentials configured in Jenkins. It pulls the `main` branch for processing.

### 2. **Identify Branches**
   The pipeline retrieves all remote branches and checks their last commit time. Based on the time elapsed since the last commit:
   - Branches older than **90 minutes** are flagged for archiving.
   - Branches older than **180 minutes** are flagged for deletion.

### 3. **Notify Teams**
   - Sends an email notification if any branches meet the criteria for archiving or deletion.
   - If no branches meet the criteria, a notification is sent informing the team that no branches were archived or deleted.

### 4. **Archive Branches**
   - Branches flagged for archiving are checked out, tagged with an "archived" tag, and the tag is pushed to the remote repository.
   - After archiving, the local tag is deleted.

### 5. **Delete Branches**
   - Branches flagged for deletion are deleted both locally and remotely.
   - The pipeline ensures that branches are only deleted if they exist in the repository.

### 6. **Cleanup**
   - After the pipeline completes, the workspace is cleaned up to ensure no leftover files or data.

## Prerequisites
1. **Jenkins**: Jenkins should be installed and configured to run pipelines.
2. **GitHub Repository**: The GitHub repository should contain multiple branches, and access to the repository should be configured in Jenkins.
3. **GitHub Credentials**: Set up the GitHub credentials in Jenkins to authenticate access to the repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nava200/branch-automation.git
   cd branch-automation
